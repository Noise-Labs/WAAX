Special thanks to Chris Rogers, who invented the world of web audio, for invaluable guidance and feedback.

Lastly, I sincerely thank to my CCRMAlites - Jonathan Berger, Chris Chafe, Ge Wang, John Granzow, Colin Sullivan and Juhan Nam - for their enthusiasm to help me bring new technologies into the computer music.
